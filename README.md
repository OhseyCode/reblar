### Update

Ever since I was a little child, I always struggled with following through on a project because I am very detail orientated and, as a result, often found it better to work with someone else whom thrives in bigger picture work while I then get down to the nitty gritty details of optimization. I am not sure how I progress this project as it is something I am passionate about but am struggling to let go of my need for everything to be optimized just to get something working.

JavaScript is still awful though.
